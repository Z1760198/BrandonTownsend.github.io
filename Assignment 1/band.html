<p> <strong> K-pop is notorious for not producing fullscale albums, but moreso EP's. 
I'll talk about a few of my favorite EP's Twice has released and also my favorite album 
of the two they've released. </strong> </p>

<dt><i> Twicetagram </i> </dt>
	<dd> This is by far one of Twice's strongest releases, since it has so many hits on it.
		The best song on this album is Likey, which has over 347 million views on Youtube. 
	</dd>
<dt><i>	Page Two </i> </dt>
	<dd> This EP was the release that put Twice on the map in terms of accomplished girl groups
		in K-pop. The lead single "Cheer Up" has over 314 million views on Youtube.
	</dd>
<dt><i> Twicecoaster: Lane 1 </i></dt>
	<dd> This EP is my personal favorite, because the lead single, TT, is the song that introduced
		me to the group. TT has by far the most views of any of their songs with over 432 million
		views on Youtube.
