    <center><h1>About Me:</h1></center>
    <p style="font-size: 115%"> Hello there! My name is Brandon Townsend and this is my Web Presense Project. I'm currently an OM&IS major at Northern Illinois University. I hope to be graduating on May 11th, 2019 with my bachelor's degree
	and a minor in Data Analytics. My cumulative GPA is 3.66, and I've studied all 4 years at NIU. I'm excited to graduate and start my career in the IT field, hopefully working my way up the ranks in a corporate environment.
	My main goal is to find a good work/life balance, but I understand how difficult that can be. Hopefully, my education at NIU has prepared me adequately to start real life!
